# Siddhi

Siddhi is a Streaming and Complex Event Processing engine that understands Streaming SQL queries in order to capture events from diverse data sources, process them, detect complex conditions, and publish output to various endpoints in real time.

## Installation:

We use the Siddhi Runner distribution as local microservice as part of GEDSys, but other distributions should also work.

**Requirements:**
